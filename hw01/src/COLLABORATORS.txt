Name: Kenny Yau
I worked on this assignment for 2.5-3 hours
I consulted NumPy docs to understand how various submodules such as `np.random` work
I also consulted those docs to find relevant functions for implementing the homework,
namely `np.random.permutation` for shuffling the rows in a dataset 
and `np.ceil` for rounding a number up to the nearest integer
