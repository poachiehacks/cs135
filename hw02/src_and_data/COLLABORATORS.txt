Total time: 6.5 hours

Resources consulted:
- google to find out which python library + function can do polynomial linear regression
- geeks for geeks to understand what PF.fit() does
- poured over Polynomial Features page of sklearn to understand what fit() and transform() do
- had issues combining training folds due to unfamiliarity with how np.vstack handles 1D arrays



Humans consulted:
- none

Parts of the assignment that caused me to seek help:
- reconciling the difference between model.predict() and transformed @ model.coef_ + model.intercept_
- array shapes: making sure they were what different functions expected
